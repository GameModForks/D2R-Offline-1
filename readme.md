# Diablo II: Resurrected - Offline Patcher

A simple tool that remaps & bypasses *Diablo II Resurrected* module and then continues to patch connection functions to allow local gameplay. 

More information about the crc32 bypassing and remapping can be found in my '[Bypassing World of Warcraft's Read-Only Code Protection (crc32)](https://ferib.dev/blog.php?l=post/Bypassing_World_of_Warcraft_Crc32_Integrity_Checks)' blog post

# Setup
## Installation


1. You will need the Diablo II: Resurrected game files.

1. You may also need [.NET Framework v4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer).

1. Download the latest release *(or clone the project and build it)* :  
https://github.com/ferib/D2R-Offline/releases  
Unzip and copy **both** `D2ROffline.exe` and `patches.txt` to your Diablo II: Resurrected game folder. They should be in the same directory as `Game.exe`.

## Run

1. Double-click `D2ROffline.exe` to start the tool.

1. A cmd window should open and begin the patching process.

1. Done!

When loading a character, use the TCP/IP button and host a game, double clicking the character name or clicking Play will not work by default. See the `-FixLocalSave` argument under [Usage](#Usage) if you would like to edit your saves to play in offline mode *(including act1 to act5)*.

## Please see the [FAQ](FAQ.md) if you have any issues.

# Usage

## Arguments
You can run `D2ROffline.exe` with arguments to solve some problems.

### -FixLocalSave
`.\D2ROffline.exe -FixLocalSave` This will update your save files to allow you to play your characters in single-player mode *(act3 to act5 included)* instead of hosting a TCP/IP game. This argument prevents the game from loading and will just patch your save files. Please note that this will also unlock all quests so that you can jump right into all acts.

### -FixLocalSaveNoQuests`
`.\D2ROffline.exe -FixLocalSaveNoQuests` Does the same as `-FixLocalSave` but without unlocking any quests.

### -UpdateKeyBinds
`.\D2ROffline.exe -UpdateKeyBinds` This will sync your keybindings between characters.

### -Delay \<delay in ms>
`.\D2ROffline.exe C:\D2R\Game.exe -Delay 35` This will change the delay amount when patching your game, default is 25. Use this and try different values to help with crashes after being in-game for certain amounts of time.

### "Game.exe file path"
`.\D2ROffline.exe C:\D2R\Game.exe` Use this to specify a path to Game.exe if you're not running `D2ROffline.exe` from the same directory.

### Passing arguments
`.\D2ROffline C:\D2R\Game.exe -txt -direct -whatever -w` The patcher will pass all other arguments, which are in our case `-txt -direct -whatever -w`, to the game so that you can launch them as you wish.

## Custom Patches

There is a neat little feature that allows you to use the `patches.txt` file and create your own patching rules, the `patches.txt` file **MUST** be in the same folder as the executable!
This allows you to create your own patches.

_NOTE: The above patches are modifying the .text section of the game, for those that want to patch the .data section you can simply use Cheat Engine because the anti-cheating does not scan those areas for modified values._

## Mutiplayer (tcp/ip)
Want to test out multiplayer mode? feel free to join my (premature) server emulator at ~~`ferib.dev`~~ `d2rga.net` and come say hi!
For those who are interested in the server emulation project, check it out at [d2rga.net](http://d2rga.net) for more info!

Also, feel free to [donate money](https://github.com/sponsors/ferib) in case you made it this far, this will keep me motivated to work on Diablo2Resurrected related projects and to keep the server going, thanks!
